This project is the control the speaker settings in my basement. This is the software portion to control a 
custom hardware relay panel.

There are three possible speaker configurations:
 1- Traditional 7.1 surround sound
 2- Stereo - Including two extra speakers to extend the sound the full room
 3- Outside 3 speakers for outdoor parties
